This cookbook is based on the principle, "choose a platform, and script the shit
out of it." It eschews community cookbook dependencies in favour of the basic
commands available in Chef itself. This makes for simpler installs, provided
you stick to the chosen platform.

The chosen platform is Ubuntu 16.04 LTS 64 bit server (xenial xerus). The recipes
have been tested on this, and nothing else.

For the xenial64 vagrant box provided by Ubuntu, the default user created is "ubuntu".

If you want to change platform, you'll need to edit the recipes appropriately.
