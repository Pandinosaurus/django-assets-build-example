# Create a pseudo-production environment in the VM to mimic production in certain key aspects:
# * uwsgi in emperor mode
# * uwsgi will run the app as the www-data user
# * app will be stored in /var/apps/#{project_name}. Each deploy will go
#   into a timestamped subdirectory; the current version will be symlinked to a `current` directory.
# * uwsgi log: /var/log/uwsgi/#{project_name}.log
# * nginx access log: /var/log/nginx/#{project_name}.access.log
# * nginx error log: /var/log/nginx/#{project_name}.error.log
# * uwsgi socket: /var/run/uwsgi/#{project_name}.sock (owner: www-data:www-data)
#
# The idea being:
# * In development, work with the django development server.
# * Access the development server from the host machine as localhost:8000
# * From within the VM, deploy to the VM-based pseudo-production environment
#   * When you ssh into the VM, you're using the 'ubuntu' user. All deployment tools (e.g. node) can assume this user.
#   * The app in the pseudo-production environment will be run under the www-data account.
# * From the host machine, access the app via nginx at localhost:8080
